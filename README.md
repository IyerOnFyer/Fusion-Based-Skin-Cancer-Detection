## Introduction
- This repository provides code for the research "_**A Dermoscopic Skin Lesion Classification Technique using YOLO-CNN and Traditional Feature Model**_"
- The dataset can be downloaded from here. It is openly available:
- https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2016/39 (David Gutman, Noel CF Codella, Emre Celebi, Brian Helba, Michael Marchetti, Nabin Mishra, and Allan Halpern. Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI) 2016, hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC). arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.01397, 2016.)

## Steps to run the code
- First download the images from the above mentioned websites. They are open-source so the images are freely available
- The YOLO folder contains the source files to build the darkflow model. Darkflow is an implementation of the darknet model for tensorflow as created by thtrieu.
